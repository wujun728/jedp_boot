evaluation
==========

This simple example aims to provide an example usage of:
- Human tasks
- Persistence
- Process Variable Mapping
- Singleton session manager
- Maven

This application uses single session. Other session strategies (session managers) can be demonstrated later. So far the example supports only dependencies from jBPM 6 as community project.


### Steps to run
- Make sure you have at least Java 6 and Maven 3 installed
- Import project to IDE(eclipse)
- Run `org.jbpm.demo.evaluation.ProcessMain` as Java Application
- Run `org.jbpm.demo.evaluation.ProcessTest` as JUnit Test
